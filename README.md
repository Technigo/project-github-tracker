# GitHub Tracker

This week's project was to build a site that keep track of all my repositories that I have created during my time at Technigo. The main purpose of this project was to display information about the projects that I have built, using GitHub API.

## The problem

I started off by fetching all of my repositories and data from the GitHub API. Once I had all the data I needed I dispayed it on the page. Then I started to do a quick scetch in Figma on how I wanted to style the page and then tried to come as close as possible. Of course with the mind set of mobile first.

I struggled a lot with the API token this week, and I had a hard time to publish the site on Netlify.

If I had more time, or less trouble with token-issues, I would add a sort function and a search field. And also I had investigated more time with the styling, as always :)
