# GitHub Tracker

This weeks project was about deepening our knowledge of API and also some unit testing. 

## The problem

I've had huge issues with getting my personal token to work and I must say that it has defeted me, I never managed to solve it (this time). I have never spent so much time on a single problem, but I still like the fact that I never gave in, I kept trying. 

If I had more time, I would make the token work :D
