# GitHub Tracker

The aim of this project was to build a GitHUb tracker of my projects submitted thus far to Technigop, using fetch and API technologies from the GitHub database
## The problem

I approached the problem in 2 main steps: first extracting data from a -filtered-API fetch of all of my forked projects from Technigo. I was then able to hard-code a crad to present this data. I secondly then performed another fetch to extract the pull-requests from the Technigo repositories, to FIND all of my commit message for each submitted project. I then used dynamic-ids to input this data into my pre-coded index-card. Using Chart.js, I compiled a doughnut chart to illustrate the percentage of projects completed thus far. I have fulfilled all blue requirements, if I had more time I would like to show the last commit message and maybe a few comments.
