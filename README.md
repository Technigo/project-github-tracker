# GitHub Tracker

Creating a place to keep track of the GitHub repos made during my Boot Camp at Technigo. Using JavaScript, html, css and fetching data from API's from the JSON response.

## The problem

My page includes:

- A list of all repos that are forked from Technigo
- Username and profile picture
- Most recent update (push) for each repo
- Name of default branch for each repo
- URL to the actual GitHub repo
- Number of commits for each repo
- It is responsive (mobile first)
- A visualisation, a donut chart, of how many projects I've done so far, compared to how many I will do.
