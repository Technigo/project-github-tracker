# GitHub Tracker

The assignment was to create a place to keep track of the GitHub repos that I use at Technigo. The focus was JavaScript and API.

## The problem

In the beginning of the project it felt like there were a lot of API fetches that needed to be done and. It was also hard to understand were to place, and where to call the different functions. I also struggled with writing short and clean code and sometimes ended up with writing several codes extra.

The solution were to scale down the project and do small chunks at a time. Create a TODO and check off everything during the work progress.
