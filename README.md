# GitHub Tracker

I created a tracker to show the GitHub repositories for the projects I have done for Technigo's web development boot camp. The user can see my user name, GitHub profile image, every project repo I have forked, and info about the individual projects.

## The problem

This was the first time I used an API in an individual project. I was very confused about the Javascript concepts, and found it hard to understand how to complete the project. After some googling and help from team mates, I managed to finish the project.
I played around more with the design, but still don't feel comfortable creating a design from scratch. If I had more time I would search for more inspiration on the design part of the project. I would also like to add more data from the API into the repo cards.
