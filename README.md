# GitHub Tracker

Week 6 project was to create a GitHub tracker using GitHub API

## The problem

If I had more time I would definitely spend it on the design, both for the whole page and also for the chart. I also would have wanted to add some more functions, like search field and adding my team mates profile pictures in the shared repos.
