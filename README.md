# GitHub Tracker

The goal of this project was to create a simple portfolio looking website, displaying information about yourself and your projects. The challenge was that all the info would be fetched from Github. 

## The problem

In this project I found it challenging to correctly source the information that I wanted to display. I solved this by console loging all my fetched data and taking the time to understand the data returned to me. I also found the styling of the chart tricky. If I would have had more time I would have wanted to style the chart more and display more information about the projects, fetched from Github.
