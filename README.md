# GitHub Tracker ðŸ“Š

This weeks project was to create a GitHub tracker using JavaScript and GitHub API.

## The problem

I started the project by fetching the data and filtered the repositories I wanted to show on my site. My main struggle this week was JavaScript, I found it hard to create more structure of it. To solve my problem I discussed a lot with my team and asked questions in StackOverflow. If I had more time I would like to fetch more data to display on my page, and also make it even more responsive.
