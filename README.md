# GitHub Tracker

A GitHub-like page where you can track all of the projects which I will build at Technigos boot camp. For this project, I continued my journey with JavaScript and digging deeper into API.

# What I learned

- how to fetch data from API 
- how to pass data to functions 
- how to use filter/find functions 

# View it live
