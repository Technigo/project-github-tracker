# GitHub Tracker

This assignment was structued to create fetch functions to showcase data coming from Githubs API.
Part of the assigment was to design a page that would show fetched data.

## The problem

First of I started by creating all the main functions that I would need to fullfill the blue requirements.
I used HTML, CSS and Javascript languages to write my code in VS code and deployed my site through netlify.

Secondly I decided on a simple HTML CSS styling that would focus on the fetched data. I made the site responsive through all viewports and added very few animations to make the site look and feel proffesional and to the point.

If I had more time I would make my site Universal to any github account instead of Personal.
