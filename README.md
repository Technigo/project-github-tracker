# GitHub Tracker

In this project we were suppose to build a tracker of all our projects related to Technigo using GitHub API. The site should include:


- A list of all repos forked from Technigo
- Username and profile picture
- Most recent push for each repo
- Default branch for each repo
- URL to the actual GitHub repo
- Number of commits per repo
- Chart showing completed projects/total.


## The problem

In order to solve the problem I've worked with API's and a personal token. A challening project where there still are things needed to be fixed (when the chart is showing only 2 out of 5 projects are visible).
