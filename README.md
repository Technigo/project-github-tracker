# GitHub Tracker

Project making a GitHub tracker that tracks my profile repositories data with the help of GitHub API's and presents it on a page.

## The problem

Watched the Technigo session lectures and resources to get an idea how to approach the task at hand. Tried to make it look sort of similar to GitHub.
Used a lot of fetch of APIs and tried to figure out which data that was relevant to use and how to add it on the page in a good way.
If I had more time I would've wanted to grab more data and charts adding more content.
