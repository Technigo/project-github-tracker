# GitHub Tracker

This week I create a place to keep track of the GitHub repos.
HTML,CSS and javascript.


## The problem
I started with fetching the information  through API.
then I tried to figure out how to filter the information I needed.
When I had information i displayed it on the site.
Styled with CSS (mobile first).

If I had more time I would try to include a search bar and also which languages the projects includes.
