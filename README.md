# GitHub Tracker

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

This week I made a Github tracker, were you can scroll through my Technigo repositories. It also includes a chart of compleated and remaining projects in the Bootcamp.

Made with JS, using API and authorization keys.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

This week has been a good week were I found the project fun and fairly easy. I feel like I understand API and how to work with them. I had a bit issue with the authorization key/token, but managed to make it work!
