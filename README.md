# GitHub Tracker
The task was to fetch repos from GitHub and use the information on the website. 

## The problem
I had a methodological approach to the problem and solved one task at the time. I thing the fetching and the javaScript part of the task went really well, but i have struggled a bit with the CSS part. I did'nt have the same methodological approach to the CSS, i guess i miss calculated how difficult it was. So i had to redo some things in the very end. 

I'm still not so pleased with the CSS turnout. If i had more time i would make the username and profile picture appear nicer, in line.
