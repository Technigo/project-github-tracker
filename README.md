# GitHub Tracker
This is about tracking my Github proejcts from Technigo using Github's API to fetch data.

## The problem

The main problem was understanding the project and the guidelines. 
My CSS could have been nicer and I need to deepen my knowledge about CSS.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
