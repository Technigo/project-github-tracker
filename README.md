# GitHub Tracker

Week 7 of bootcamp, this is a github tracker tracking projects from the Technigo bootcamp using github api. The site is built mainly using JavaScript, its a heading with the github user avatars and a project list with all repos linked to the Technigo bootcamp. The project card shows some info regarding the status of the project. At the bottom there is a pie chart showing the progress in the bootcamp. The project/repo list os possible to sort and filter.

## The problem

The challenge this week was to get the asynchronous nature of fetch to work with multiple fetches within a fetch, for this I used Promise.All. It was also a challenge to get the filters and sort working.
