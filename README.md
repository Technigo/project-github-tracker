# GitHub Tracker

This project was built to track all of the repositories that I have created during my time at Technigo. The main
purpose of this project is to display information about the projects that I have built using Githubs API.

## The project

I started off this project by fetching all of my repositories and data from GitHubs API. Once I had all the data 
that I needed I dispayed it on multiple pages. One page focusing on displaying the repository data and the other to 
display the commits data. This project also include a visualization of how many projects I have done so far, compared 
to how many I will in total using Chart.js. Lastly, I styled the pages similar to the GitHubs page layout, with the 
mind set of mobile first.

If I had more time I would add a page for my pull requests data and I would like to add a search input so that users 
can search for a specific repositiory. Also to include a dropdown button that allows users to filter through repos 
based off of the language they are written in.
