# GitHub Tracker

This weeks assignment was to create a responsive tracker website for Github repos by using the Github API.

## The problem

I started the project by gathering all the necessary information using the fetch() method. After that I started to build the functions for using the information and refactored the code. All functionalities were done with Javascript. With Javascript I also created a chart to show data about course progress.

With more time, I would like to use the collected data to show more information through different functionalities, for example the accordion to show review or commit messages from projects.
