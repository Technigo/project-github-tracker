# GitHub Tracker

It's a website where you can track my project development. There is a function where you can filter through my repos based on most used language, eg JavaScript. The repos are sorted by newest date. There are also links to the GitHub repos and to social media websites like LinkedIn.

## The problem

Used google, stackoverflow and technigo's on-call-support.
