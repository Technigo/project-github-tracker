# GitHub Tracker

### What to include

- A list of all repos that are forked ones from Technigo
- Your username and profile picture
- Most recent update (push) for each repo
- Name of your default branch for each repo
- URL to the actual GitHub repo
- Number of commit messages for each repo
- All pull requests
- A chart of how many projects you've done so far, compared to how many you will do using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/). [Here](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/)'s documentation on how to get started, and in the left menu you can also find [example usage](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/usage.html).

## Requirements ðŸ§ª

Your project should fulfil the three **ðŸ”µ  Blue Level Requirements** , **ðŸ”´ Red Level** and **âš«  Black Level Requirements** to push your knowledge to the next level!

### **ðŸ”µ  Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)**

Your page should include:

- A list of all repos that are forked from Technigo
- Your username and profile picture
- Most recent update (push) for each repo
- Name of your default branch for each repo
- URL to the actual GitHub repo
- Number of commits for each repo
- It should be responsive (mobile first)
- A visualisation, for example through a pie chart, of how many projects you've done so far, compared to how many you will do (in total it will be 19 weekly projects ðŸ¥³).

### **ðŸ”´  Red Level (Intermediary Goals)**

- Sort your list in different ways.
**Example of what you can sort by:** creation date, name, most commits, followers or stargazers
- Create the opportunity to filter the repos based on a condition, e.g. only JavaScript repos
- Display the actual commit messages for each repo in a good way. Maybe by adding a modal (popup) or an accordion?
- Display the comments you got from each pull request
- When you're browsing through the repo object, you'll see that there's a lot of data that we can use. Create a chart over some of the data.
**Example of data to use:** Repo size, people that starred your repo (stargazers) or amount of commits on each repo.

### **âš«  Black Level (Advanced Goals)**

- Implement a search field to find a specific repo based on name

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
