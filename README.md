# GitHub Tracker

This project is to track the github repositories created during Technigo Boot Camp
## The problem

The challenge for this week was the limit of 60 request per hour for github API. Therefore, first, I worked on functionality without any styling, then, I did styling with placeholders and at the end i merged both of them to have the final version.

I have completed most of the requirements. If i had more time, I would have add sorting and more visual representation of data.
