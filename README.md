# GitHub Tracker

The week 7 project was creating a github tracker to keep track of the GitHub repos using GitHub API. The pie chart shows the number of projects that I have done at technigo and number of projects left to be done using Chart.js.

## The problem
This project was roller-coaster ride and I could learn a lot about how to fetch from Api and invoking the functions. I solved my problems by googling, stack overflow and town-hall sessions. If I had more time, I would like to add some more data to display and added bit more styling.
