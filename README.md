# GitHub Tracker

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.
#What to include

- A list of all repos that are forked ones from Technigo
- Your username and profile picture
- Most recent update (push) for each repo
- Name of your default branch for each repo
- URL to the actual GitHub repo
- Number of commit messages for each repo
- All pull requests
- A chart of how many projects you've done so far, compared to how many you will do using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/). [Here](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/)'s documentation on how to get started, and in the left menu you can also find [example usage](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/usage.html).

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
