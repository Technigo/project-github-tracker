# GitHub Tracker

This weeks project was to create a place to keep track of the GitHub repos that we're using at Technigo.

## The problem

To solve the problem we practiced JavaScript and learned more about API with the help of GitHubs own documentation.
I started with looking deeper into the documentation and by using the fetch and forEach functions with the filter method I could get hold of the information that I wanted to display. I created a donut chart displaying all the finished projects and the ones I have left to do during this Boot Camp. After that I moved on to the styling of the website using mobile first method. I spend a lot of time getting the desktop view accordingly to my sketch and used both flex box and grid to get the result that I wanted. It was a really good practice for me to develope my styling skills and I am proud of the result especially for the repository cards.
If I had more time I would have continued by adding an other chart and displaying more information on the site.
