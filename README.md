# GitHub Tracker

This week's project was to build a GitHub Tracker where I keep track of all GitHub repos that I've used at Technigo. The tracker updates continuously via information from the GitHub API's, so that the projects for upcoming weeks are added to the tracker.

## The problem

The project was mostly built with JavaScript and fetched data from API's, but also styled with CSS so that it has a responsive design.
I worked a lot with my project team and figured out the logic to find the right dta from the API's, and how to display it in th right way. I practiced fetching and filtering data, creating a chart function and sorting function, and how to use dynamic id's to display information in the rigth place.
I created all the JavaScript functions first and then moved on to styling the website.
I thought the project was really hard at times, and now I am really satisfied with the result. If I had more time I would like to add a search function so that the tracker can display information from different GitHub accounts.
