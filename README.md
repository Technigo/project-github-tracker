# GitHub Tracker

The task was to create a GitHub tracker, that displays information related to the Technigo projects using GitHUb API

## The problem

I wanted to try writing async functions, maybe the result is more complicated than using the .fetch method, but I learned a lot about the async of JS. Used flex and grid to display the data.
