# GitHub Tracker

This weeks assignment was to dig dipper into API and create a GitHub tracer for our Technigo projects.

## The problem

I have to say this week was harder then expected because of Java Script, i have relied on my team more then before. If i had more time would have focused more on html/css and styling it more then i had time to do.
