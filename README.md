# Week 7- Technigo Bootcamp

# Project GitHub Tracker

This week, we want you to create a place to keep track of the GitHub repos that you're using here at Technigo. You will continue practicing your JavaScript and API skills with the help of GitHub's own documentation.

## The problem

This week the first step was to read the documentation of Github API to understand what every endpoint was about. Then I started fetching basic information and adding new functions, endpoints, and iterations in JavaScript. 

I used the `async/await` instead of `.then( )` approach to practice more about it. An interesting experience this week was digging more into promises, and how to await several promises using `Promise.all`.

I also used an independent library for vanilla Javascript as a collapsible toggle to show details for commits and comments for every Pull Request. (See `https://www.cssscript.com/content-toggle-collapsible/`).

Also was very interesting using the open-source `Chart.js` to create the chart about how many projects we finished and how many projects left at the Technigo course. (See `https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/`)
