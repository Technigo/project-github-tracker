# GitHub Tracker

The assignment was to create a GitHub Tracker. 

## The problem

Using HTML, CSS and JS. Using the API:s frm GitHub. Also first use of a chart. If I had more time I would've continued with the styling and JS functions. The styling as of now I think has too much code. 

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
