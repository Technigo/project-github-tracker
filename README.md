# GitHub Tracker

GitHub tracker built with HTML, CSS and Javascript

## The problem

- Use api to import all repos forked from Technigo(for each repo add default branch, most recent update (push), url,
 number of commit messages and pull requests), username and profile picture.  
 
- Add a chart of how many projects you've done so far
