# GitHub Tracker

This project is a tracker made with Javascript. 
It is made to fetch data from the GitHub API.

## The problem

I actually found this project to be the most simple this far. I felt that what we were supposed to do was easy and I think that the knowledge from the previous projects helped a lot. I have easily been able to use my knowledge to create and do what I wanted with Javascript. I also have styled the page to my liking. 

For this project I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
