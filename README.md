# GitHub Tracker

## The problem

The assignment was to built a github tracker, using API's to fetch informations about our Technigo projects. We needed to filter and find certain bits of the arrays to get the correct information. 

It has been a fun, but difficult project. To me, the lessons has been very useful. I can read the code and more or less understand it, but I have a hard time coming up with the correct solutions on my own. 
I followed dthe lessons and then implemented what I had learned in my on code. I always rewrote the code (I didn't copy paste) in order to grasp what I was doing. 
I coded togehter with my team several times, it was great.

I focused on getting all the js/chart in place first, and then went on with tha styling. It was more challenging than I thought, but by asking my team and looking at stack overflow I think it went well!

If I had more time I would look into the red and black requirements. And add a footer with som contact info. 

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
