# GitHub Tracker

Week 7 project on Technigo Bootcamp. 
We were supposed to make GitHub tracker that gathers our Technigo Repositories. 

## The problem

My biggest problem this week was to make all the fetches and to fetch the different values, like pullrequests, commits etc. After some help I finally managed to fetch everything and to get them in the right place. If I would have had more time I would maybe have added a searchfield but on the other hand we wont have that many Technigo repositories so it doesn't feel like a must. 

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
