# GitHub Tracker

This project is all about working with the Github-API.

The tracker shows
- username/pic
- all the repos that are done by me during the Technigo bootcamp 
- no. of commits and commit messages for each repository
- a doughnut pie from chart.js




## The problem

I focussed in this project on gaining data from the API and filter/sort it in a way that I get all the entries I want to show in my tracker.

I kept the design simple and made it look close to the original GitHub-website. 

If I would have more time, I would like to add "no. of commits" to the sort field and maybe add a search field also.
