# GitHub Tracker

Created a GutHub Tracker to continue practice APIs and fetch.

## The problem

If I had more time I would definitely spend it on the design, both for the whole page as well as for the chart. I also would have wanted to add some more functions, like search field and adding my team mates profile pictures in the shared repos.
