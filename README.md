# The problem

I had a hard time with JavaScript this week (and with styling). I also struggled with time management but have a project to hand in altough itÂ´s not completly finnished, still have a grid layout for desktop & tablet to organize. 
I used google, Stack Owerflow and YouTube this week as help and of course my team helped me a lot.
