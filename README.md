# GitHub Tracker

Github tracker uses various parts of the Github REST api to reproduce some data from different github projects. 

## The problem

This week I began by reading and reviewing the learning materials before starting the project. I found it quite hard to plan this week as I didn't know exacly what information would be found in each endpoint and so what I would want to display. So I found that both the HTML and CSS were hard to write or plan beforehand. If I were to do this project again I would look through the api first so that I could plan how my HTML and CSS would look, then go back to the javascript after this.
