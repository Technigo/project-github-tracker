# GitHub Tracker

The aim of the project was to build a personal github tracker that would show my technigo-projects. This was done by fetching and displaying data from API's, using forEach, filter and find methods. A doughnut chart was also implemented to give a visual display of the amount of projects done. In terms of styling, a CSS grid and a hero header was used.

## The problem

In the beginning of the project it felt like there were a lot of API fetches that needed to be done. It was also hard to understand were to place, and where to call the different functions. 
The solution were to scale down the project and do small chunks at a time.
