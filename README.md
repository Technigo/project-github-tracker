# Project GitHub Tracker

Weekly project for Technigo's bootcamp, week 7: build a GitHub tracker

The project is to build a GitHub tracker to gather my Technigo repositories in order to practice JavaScript and API skills through GitHub API. It contains some data about the repositories like commit messages, lastest push and so on.

## The problem

At first I felt some stress since there was no starter code to begin with and it felt like a big mountain to climb. But in the end, I found it quite easy and interesting to work with many fetches nested inside one another. My biggest struggles were to style the charts with chart.js since the documentation wasn't always clear and to deal with the layout I chose (card with tab buttons). Even if I always want to reach more advanced goals, I didn't feel the need to add a filter or a search field since the number of repositories is quite low, and it didn't seemed a big challenge anyway.
