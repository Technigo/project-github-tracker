# GitHub Tracker

The assignment was to creata a GitHub tracker that used APIs to keep track of all my projects forked by Technigo in Github. We also had to creat a chart to show our progress. 

## The problem

This week it was most difficult to understand how to use the APIs from Github and collect the right information. Past week the APIs were more straight forward compared to this week. 

I learnt a lot about how to style from the script file, something I was a bit worried about since we had to style things that didn't excist in the HTML from the beginning. But I noticed that it wasn't that complicated.
