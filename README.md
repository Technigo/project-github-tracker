# GitHub Tracker

The assignment this week was to create a page that keeps track of the repositories that I have forked and worked on during the Technigo Bootcamp. The project allowed me to get a deeper knowledge of how to use API:s.

## The problem

I started out by breaking down the project in smaller pieces and focused on fetching all the API:s. It was sometimes hard to understand where to place the different chunks of code in Javascript, for example where to call the functions and grasp how everything should be connected. If I had more time I would add some more information to the repos, for example display the commit messages and/or the comments from each pull request.
