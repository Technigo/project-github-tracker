# GitHub Tracker

This week, we have created a place to keep track of the GitHub repos that Im using here at Technigo.

## The problem

I struggeled a lot this week to get the API part. I had to watch other project to understand how to handle the commit part.
When I finally was done I hade a bug that I coulnÂ´t find the solution for. I wrote the question at Stackowerflow. 
The issue was ONE simple linebreak.
