# GitHub Tracker

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

Using Github API to fetch information about our Technigo projects such as user profile, repos, pullrequests and commit messages. Displaying them nicely and drawing a chart to see progress.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

My team and I was working closely in our team room so that we could support eachother and ask for help. I planned to do the majority of the javascript at the beginning of the week so I had everything before going in to styling. This was a great progress for me so that I don't jump to much back and forth between my code files.

I have not solved my modal but I have a conversation ongoing in stackoverflow.
