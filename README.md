# GitHub Tracker
The gitHub tracker project was all about fetching the repositories from my gitHub that was forked from Technigo, and get some user info and project info.

## The problem

I really liked this project, even if I have a really hard time with the javascript syntax. This week I gave the live sessions a repetition which gave a lot. I decided how I wanted to structure tha page and had to make som changes and additions in both html file and inner.html in the javascript file. I also managed to change the type of chart I used. 

If I hade more time I would like to look at how to implement a searchfield to be able to search for repos. Did try to implement a popup. But actually gave up ðŸ˜… and decided to try out a more simole tooltip. 

It was a bit frustrating to work with only 60 requests per hour... Need to learn how to get past that problem!
