# GitHub Tracker

The assignment was to create a place to keep track of the GitHub repos that I'm using at the Technigo bootcamp. Following things should be included in this project:
- A list of all repos that are forked ones from Technigo
- Your username and profile picture
- Most recent update (push) for each repo
- Name of your default branch for each repo
- URL to the actual GitHub repo
- Number of commit messages for each repo
- All pull requests
- A chart of how many projects you've done so far, compared to how many you will do

## The problem


## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
