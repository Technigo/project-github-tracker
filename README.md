# GitHub Tracker
This weeks assignment is to create a tracker for technigo repositories fetched from GitHub API.

## The problem
This week I have googled so much and stack overflow has really helped me alot with my problems. Lectures helped as well where I learnt about the github token and how to set commits to 0. 

If I had more time I would change the tooltip to instead have the name of the languages written out at the top of the projects to the right and I would add a search bar for projects.
