# GitHub Tracker

This weeks project was creating a git hub tracker with a list of all my Technigo Repositories as well as amount of commits for each repo. 

## The problem

I used javascript, CSS and some html. I encountered most problem in the beginning when trying to fetch my data from github. I followed Jennies and Maks videos and constantly ran out of fetches. Eventually I managed. For styling I looked at my teammate Maria Sj√∂grens Code and implemented it step by step, by doing that I learned a lot of things that I didn't know before. 

What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
If I had more time I would work more on the links, because I want them to open in a new window but I didnt manage to do it. I would also try to put the chart in the profile-section and add som red level stuff.
