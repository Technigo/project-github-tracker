# GitHub Tracker

This project was built to track all of the repositories that I have created duringmy time at Technigo. The main
purpose of this project is to display information about the projects that I have built. 

## The problem

I started off this project by fetching all of my repositories and data from the GitHub API. Once I had all the data 
I needed I dispayed it on the page. Then I styled the page similar to the GitHub page layout, with the mind set of 
mobile first. 

If I had more time I would add a page for my pull requests and add funtionalities to the buttons on the page to be
able to sort my repositories based off of language, type, and so on... Lastly, I would want to add JavaScript to 
the input field so a user can search for a specific repository.
