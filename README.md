# GitHub Tracker

The aim of the project was to build a personal github tracker that would show my technigo-projects. This was done by fetching and displaying data from API's, using forEach, filter and find methods. A doughnut chart was also implemented to give a visual display of the amount of projects done. In terms of styling, a CSS grid and a hero header was used. 

It was a fun and challenging project in terms of understanding the javascript flow, but I am happy with the result. If I had more time, I would like to make a search function and sort the repositories based on dates.
