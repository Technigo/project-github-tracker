# GitHub Tracker

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Create a website where I can track my GitHub status that updates when something has been added or pushed. And also show how many commits and pull requests have been made by me. 

## The problem

This was very hard and I still need to figure out how to use the dynamic ID to make everything work. As for now, my commits and pull requests does not show as I couldnt get them into the correct place in he innerHTML. Will continue to look into that and solve it.
