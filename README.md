# GitHub Tracker

Create a tracker for my progress as a student at Technigo bootcamp. 

## The problem

I started with getting the fetches, trying to remember everything from last weeks project. Hade some trouble with (a lot) but "small things" like remembering to pass along the filtered repos and calling functions. This project was intense but I pulled through (pun intended). 
With more time I would tried harder to get the token to work. And as always more time on styling.
