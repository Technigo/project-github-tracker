# GitHub Tracker

The aim of this weekly technigo-project was to create a github-tracker by getching data from severeal APIs.

## Reflections

One of my biggest struggle during this project was understanding in what order the code was executed. I tried to create an array of objects with key-value pairs from different API-urls and the information was not logged in order. 

Using objects instead of dynamic id's to add info about each repo was in hindsight not easier even though I thought so from the beginning. It have taken me alot longer to finish this weeks project because of that. It might have been a good learning experience, where one of the lessons was - always read trough and follow the instructions before trying something on my own!

THe styling did not get much focus since a lot of the time was spent on js. I am proud of using variables for my colors and the use of flexbox. 

In the end I managed to create every object and add a sorting-functions which used the array of objects. Even if it took me some time, I feel proud of the final product and I have learned a lot.
