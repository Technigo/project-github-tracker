# GitHub Tracker

The brief was to create a tracker over all of our forked technigo projects from Github, as well as a chart showing our current progress.

## The problem

I first tried the API and played around to try to find the different data I would need, and where I would find the links to the rest of the fetches I needed. After feeling comfortable with where I could find the different information I needed, I began setting up my javascript. I didn't spend much time on design this week, and I struggled a bit with the chart.js documentation, but in the end I was very satisfied with the solutions I came up with. I also spent some time debugging a few small issues I had and refactoring my code to make it more readable.
