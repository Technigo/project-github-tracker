# GitHub Tracker

Week 7 project on Technigo Bootcamp. 
We were supposed to make GitHub tracker that gathers our Technigo Repositories. 

## The problem

My biggest problem this week was to make all the fetches and to fetch the different values, like pullrequests, commits etc. After some help I finally managed to fetch everything and to get them in the right place. If I would have had more time I would maybe have added a searchfield but on the other hand we wont have that many Technigo repositories so it doesn't feel like a must.
