# GitHub Tracker

This assignment was to create a GitHub tracker using API's from GitHub to display information about forked projects done during Technigo Boot Camp. 

## The problem

I started working with the blue requirements and after I had completed the tasks on blue level I continued working on the styling in CSS to make the page look like GitHub. However, if I had more time I would work more with getting the page more similar to GitHub and also adding some of the red and black requirements.
