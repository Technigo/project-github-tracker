# GitHub Tracker
Assigment: To create a place to keep track of the GitHub repos that I am using at Technigo using JavaScript and API:s. 

## The problem
I had problems with fetching teh commitsamount for my repos since all of them didnt have a pullrequest done by me. I solved it by adding conditional statment to sort out the repos with a pullrequest and only fetcinh the commitamount for them.
