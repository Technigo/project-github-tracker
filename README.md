# GitHub Tracker

Making a GitHub tracker over our repositories using API.

## The problem

I had a lot of problems with getting the API token to work, but managed to solve that with some help. It was a bit hard to know what fetch to put where and so on, but it is working, and I'm happy about the outcome. It was a fun project. If I had more time, I would fetch more information about my repos.
