# GitHub Tracker

This Github tracker project was made on week 7 for Technigo bootcamp. 
This week's goal was to deepen the knowledge about APIs and fetch some data using GitHub REST API documentation. So this Github tracker keeps track of the GitHub repos that we create during studies in Technigo. 

## The problem

I really enjoyed fetching required information from API to my project and did not have any problems on the way. But it was a bit challenging to work with Chart.js and try some other types of chart, in my case I tried bar chart for repo sizes. This task required good JavaScript skills and understanding of local and global scopes as well as good uinderstanding of the documentation on configuration of charts. I'm very proud that I've tried some of requirements for red level and if I had more time I would add a modal popup for commit messages or comments for each repo.
