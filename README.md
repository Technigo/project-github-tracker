# GitHub Tracker

The GitHub Tracker is gathering data from my repositories and pull requests on GitHub by fetching data from GitHub API and display it on a website.

### **ðŸ”µ  Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)**

Your page should include:

- A list of all repos that are forked from Technigo
- Your username and profile picture
- Most recent update (push) for each repo
- Name of your default branch for each repo
- URL to the actual GitHub repo
- Number of commits for each repo
- It should be responsive (mobile first)
- A visualisation, for example through a pie chart, of how many projects you've done so far, compared to how many you will do (in total it will be 19 weekly projects ðŸ¥³) using [Chart.js]



## The problem

Process:
- Prototype in Figma.
- Fetch data from API and display it to fulfill the requirements. 
- Created a chart for the progress.
- Style the page.
- Made a sorting function.
- Made a modal to show comments.

I struggled a lot with the sorting function and the modal. I had to break down the steps in to pieces and solve one thing at the time. 
I also had to restructure my code a bit and ask some team mates for help. I am really proud of the outcome of the project this week. 
The feeling when it all worked was really good!  

If I had more time I would try to include a search bar and also which languages the projecs includes.
