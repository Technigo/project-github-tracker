# GitHub Tracker

The assignment was to create a place to keep track of the GitHub repos from the Technigo bootcamp. 

## The problem

All the problems will be added here soon...
If I had more time with this project I would like to spend it on the styling to make it less shitty lmao xd

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
