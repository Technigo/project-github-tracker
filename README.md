## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
My biggest issue was with getting the fetch for number of commits but solved the problem in the end with help from student collegue. 
I had passed on the wrong parameters and was actually looking for the commits in the wrong place.
