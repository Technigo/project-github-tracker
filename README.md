# GitHub Tracker

Week 6 project was to create a GitHub tracker using GitHub API

## The problem

If I had more time I would definitely spend it on the design, both for the whole page and also for the chart. I also would have wanted to add some more functions, like search field and adding my team mates profile pictures in the shared repos.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
