# GitHub Tracker

The assigment was to create a Github tracker that shows all the github repos that is created in the Bootcamp.

## The problem

First step was to get all the correct information from the Github API on the page. Using fetch and different APIs I was able to get all the info that I later styled using CSS. With dynamic ID I was able go get certain information from one fetch into another innerHTML in another fetch.
