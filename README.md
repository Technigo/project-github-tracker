# GitHub Tracker

Github tracker project - This projects purpose is to show my accomplishments during the bootcamp. Every finished project will be documented in a graph(with the design of a doughnut). 

## The problem

Every week has been a struggle for me, due to personal obsticles. I spent a lot of time at hospital, have moved two times, and personal matters. My focus is doing one thing at the time, and catch up with every criteria for each project to finish everything.
