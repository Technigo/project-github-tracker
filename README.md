# GitHub Tracker

This week, we have created a place to keep track of the GitHub repos that we are crating at Technigo. We have continued practicing on JavaScript and API.

## The problem

Process
designed page using figma
Fetched data from API and displayed it to fulfill the requirements.
Created a chart for the progress.
Styled the page.

I started by adding my token to the project. I then collected all the info about my repos with the fetch() method.
I then builded functions to us the information I needed and displayed it on my page. I also created a chart showing
how many projects I have done and have left to do during my technigo education.

If I had more time I would add more information about every repo: languages used for the project, review comments and link to netlify.
