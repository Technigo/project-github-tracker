# GitHub Tracker

Goal wa to create a place to keep track of the GitHub repos done during Technigo Boot Camp.

Your page should include:

- A list of all repos that are forked from Technigo
- Your username and profile picture
- Most recent update (push) for each repo
- Name of your default branch for each repo
- URL to the actual GitHub repo
- Number of commits for each repo
- It should be responsive (mobile first)
- A visualisation, for example through a pie chart, of how many projects you've done so far, compared to how many you will do (in total it will be 19 weekly projects ðŸ¥³) using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

## The problem

I started the project by fetching all my repos and and filtered only the ones that are forked from Technigo. After that I fetched each repo and filtered them with my own username. Fetching again with right URL:s I got also more information about used languages, review comments and my own commits. I also used github token to get unlimited amount of fetches. This was also my first time using chart.js to create simple doughnut chart.
