# GitHub TrackerðŸ˜Ž
This project was to create a place to keep track of the GitHub repos that I am using at Technigo. It was a good chance to practice JavaScript and API skills with the help of GitHub's own documentation.

# What Does it Include?
- A list of all repos that are forked ones from Technigo
- My username and profile picture
- Most recent update (push) for each repo
- Name of my  default branch for each repo
- URL to the actual GitHub repo
- Number of commit messages for each repo
- All pull requests
- A chart of how many projects I've done so far, compared to how many I will do using 
- 
## The problem
Diving in to an APIâ€™s documentation was a little bit overwhelming. 
1. To get started with the project, I fetched all of the repos and log them to the console.
2. Then I filtered out and only show the forked projects another branch.
3. Then I filtered out only the forks from *Technigo*. I could use the fact that Technigo projects *start* with 'project-' and the filtering was based on that.
