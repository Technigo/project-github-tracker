This weeks project where a deep dive into more APIs and to start using npm,unit tests and chart.js. 

## The problem

I started this weeks projects as usuals, looking through all information and reading the instructions.After that I did start the project by fecthing API from my gitHub repositories etc. It was hard for me to grasp what the assignment was and what I was suppose to do! So I spent a lot of time googling on the wrong search words and just trying to understand the instructions and trying to wrap my head around the task. I asked my teammates for help.
