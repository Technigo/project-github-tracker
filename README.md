# GitHub Tracker ðŸ“Š

This weeks project was to create a GitHub tracker using JavaScript and GitHub API.

## The problem

I started the project by fetching the data and filtered the repositories I wanted to show on my site. My main struggle this week was JavaScript, I found it hard to create more structure of it. To solve my problem I discussed a lot with my team and asked question in StackOverflow. If I had more time I would like to fetch more data to display on my page, and also make it even more responsive.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
