# GitHub Tracker

The project is to build a GitHub tracker to gather my Technigo repositories in order to practice JavaScript and API skills through GitHub API. 
It contains some data about the repositories like commits, lastest push and so on.

## The problem

I struggeled a lot this week to get the API part. I had to watch other project to understand how to handle the commit part.
When I finally was done I hade a bug that I coulnÂ´t find the solution for. I wrote the question at Stackowerflow. 
The issue was ONE simple linebreak.
