# GitHub Tracker

The assignment was to create a GitHub tracker site for the projects froked from Technigo, using fetch and API technologies from the GitHub database.

## The problem

The challange was using GitHub APIs and collect the relevant information. It was a good practise to learn more about APIs and fetch function.  
I tried to keep the design simple and as similar as the github website.
I have fulfilled all the blue requirements but if I had more time I would show the last commit message and language percentages of each project..
