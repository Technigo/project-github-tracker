# GitHub Tracker

The assignment was to create a tracker of our GitHub repositories, using their API. Flesh it out with profile name & avatar, commits per repo and a chart among a few more things. 

## The problem

We had to fetch the data from the GitHub API, parse it and present it on our page. With a lot of repositories and objects in general, we had to apply a few filters in order to find the ones we want to use.

The Rate Limit of the API (60 per hour) had me frustrated more than once. However, it was good practice to be more thorough when coding; to rely less on the Live Server output showing you small changes. DevTools is a good alternative to try iterative type of improvements.

Had the Rate Limit not been such a time sink, I would've spent more time pulling different types of data in & presenting it, sorting of the projects, and styling.
