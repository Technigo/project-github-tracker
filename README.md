# GitHub Tracker

This weeks project was to create a GitHub tracker using Javascript and the GitHub API. 

## The problem
I started the project with doing a list of all the things I wanted to fetch from the API. I then started to fetch that data. My main struggle this week was Javascript, I find it hard to know how to create more complex structure of it. To solve my problems I googled, used StackOverflow and programmed togheter with classmates. If I had more time I would like to fetch some more data to display on my page to practice to use Javascript more.
