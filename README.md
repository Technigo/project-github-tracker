# GitHub Tracker

## The problem

The assignment was to build a GitHub tracker, using APIs to fetch information about our Technigo projects. We needed to filter and find certain bits of the arrays to get the correct information. 

It has been a fun, but difficult project. To me, the lessons have been very useful. I can read the code and more or less understand it, but I have a hard time coming up with the correct solutions on my own. 
I followed the lessons and then implemented what I had learned in my own code. I always rewrote the code (I didn't copy-paste) in order to grasp what I was doing. 
I coded together with my team several times, it was great.

I focused on getting all the js/chart in place first, and then went on with the styling. It was more challenging than I thought, but by asking my team and looking at stack overflow I think it went well!

If I had more time I would look into the red and black requirements. And add a footer with some contact info.
