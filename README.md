# GitHub Tracker

They assignment was to make a Github tracker with information fetched from githubs apis.

## The problem

Initially I didnt split up the fetch and the actual rendering of the content on my site. After doing a couple of functions I realised that it would probably be a better solution to split the fetching of the data and the rendering up into different functions. This made me lose some time on the project. If I would have had more time I would probably implement a search field to find a specific repo based on the name. I would also try to make the website visually to make it more appealing for the viewer.
