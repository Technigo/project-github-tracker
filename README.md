# GitHub Tracker
Assignment to fetch Technigo Projects with name and URL +  number of commits via pull requests.
Also calculate projects made comparing to projects remaining.

## The problem
I started with the Js file - trying one API fetch at a time - console logging and then positioning the data in InnerHTML before declaring and invoking next function. After all information i needed was fetched I did the styling. Last I made the chart and the token.
I googled, used SO for checking other people questions regarding this project.
If I had more time I would have added more information like commit comments.
