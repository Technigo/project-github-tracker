# GitHub Tracker

This week's assignment is about exploring more about API and JavaScript.
We are suppose to create a GitHub Tracker, to keep track of our repos that we have created at Technigo.
Throughout the Technigo boot camp (24 weeks) we will be doing 19 different projects.

## The problem

When reading this week's project, I did not really know how to start with this assignment. It was a link to GitHub's own documentation and some example of different Endpoints we can use.
We didn't get any particular design or style to get inspired by. So it took some time to think and plan on how to structure the data we get from GitHub. But it was quite nice to try to practice designing yourself without some standard requirements.
The documentation from GitHub was massive! So it was easier to Google and apparently many had the same problems as I did. It helped a lot, especially Stack Overflow.
If I had more time I would want to tackle the higher level requirements such as adding a search field or try to sort the repos.
