# GitHub Tracker

The assignment was to create a GitHub tracker with all my Technigo-repos.

## The problem

I started by fetching all the data that I wanted from the GitHub API. I began with fetching all the repos and filtering out only the forked ones from Technigo and continued with fetching the pull requests, commits and reviews. In order to inject data from one function to another I used dynamic IDs and DOM-selector.

If I had more time I would like to add a dropdown menu were the user can choose to sort or display the repos after language. I would also like to style the GitHub tracker a bit more.
