# Project: GitHub-tracker

This week, we want you to create a place to keep track of the GitHub repos that you're using here at Technigo. 

## How did I do it?
I started the project by going through the material and videos. I really struggled mentally this week. So I decided early on that I will focus on blue level.

What I learned:
* This week it was a lot of JS and API requests. I have learned about fetch, API:S, finding info in an API and filtering. And how to add a gitHub token so you have limitless requests.👩‍💻

* This week I had a problem to understand the connection between the code. I really had to narrow in all down to small small small pieces. BUT after Maks Wednesday live session I got more of a hang of it, the cheese sandwich comparison really made it more clear to me. 

## When I hit a dead end or a problem
When a problem arose, I either googled, used stack-overflow or Chrome dev-tools. And I have talked a lot to my fellow Zebra colleagues. And I also had a 1:1 call support with Maks 🙌🏻

My own reflection
This week was really intense and I had a really big problem mentally. But in the end I solved everything and my page turned out alright 🙂
