# GitHub Tracker

This week the project was to fetch information from Github about my repositories and pull requests and display the information on a page. We were also supposed to compare data in a chart.

## The problem

I had trouble with fetching the amount of commits from the pull requests. I used my team for help and also analyzed other students code to solve it. I also had a problem with planning this project because I found it hard to understand what the end product was going to be. If I had more time I would have tried to accomplish the red and black levels.
