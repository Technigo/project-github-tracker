# GitHub Tracker

This project was built to track all of the repositories that I have created during my time at Technigo. The main
purpose of this project is to display information about the projects that I have built. 

## The project

I started off this project by fetching all of my repositories and data from the GitHubs API. Once I had all the data 
I needed I dispayed it on the page. Then I styled the page similar to the GitHub page layout, with the mind set of 
mobile first. 

If I had more time I would add a page for my pull requests and I would like to add a search input so that users can 
search for a specific repositiory. Also to have a dropdown button that allows users to filter through repos based off
of the language they are mostly written in.
