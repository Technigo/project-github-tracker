# GitHub Tracker

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

We were tasked to create a Github Tracker where we can see and are able to access all of our github repos from Technigo.

## The problem

I approached problems by using google/stackoverflow and asking friends, I didn't have much of a plan going in, I kind of wanted to make it as simple as possible. 

I had a very unfortunate week and therefore it is turned in alittle late, Basically started coding on friday and forgot to send it in on sunday as I went to bed early, I am also not finished with the project for some reason my image refuse to show up so that will be something I need to look into. I believe I did fine for the timeframe I had as I was both sick and had to go out of town and didn't have time to code then which so the only thing I would change is that I would like to go back to regular where I wont be sick and wont be out of town without a computer.

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
