# GitHub Tracker

I used an API to get hold on my information on github. A sorted out the infomation I wanted to have on my page. After that did I style the page. 
I used a chart for the first time.




## The problem

I had som problems wiht the js, that I could't se my fetches in the browser, my team mate helped me, I had mist the letter s in two places, had been wrightng commit instead om commits, and it was some more of this small but very importet thigs I had missed. 

I had som problems as well then I did the css, I was trying to style the wrong class ones. And I got help form team mates here as well. I have goolged a lot. 

I thougt it was messy to have classes in html and js.

It was a struggle to get the chart on the right place, and the border around the chart to stay as a circel.

If I had more time would I made "Link to repository" in to a button.
