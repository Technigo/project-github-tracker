# GitHub Tracker

This is my version of a GitHub Tracker. It's a webpage that displays my profile and all projects I've made during the Technigo Frontend Boot Camp together with selected information about it fetched through GitHub API's.

## The problem

I started out by studying the project brief and getting familiar to the use of the GitHub API's as I started to add code to the project. I finished the projects requirements and added extra features. The extra features includes the formatting of the fetched project name, adding the language percentage for each project and links to view the projects live. 

This project opened up my eyes to the clever use of dynamic id's. By using it I was able to keep the functions separate and invoking them with arguments in the main function (getRepos) instead of having to collect them all in the main function in a "waterfall" structure to access the values of the variables inside.

Next step would be to add if the projects has collaborators or not (group or individual assignment), names of collaborators and the commits made for projects I've been a collaborator on. To be able to sort and/or search for the projects will come in handy when the number of projects will increase.
