# GitHub Tracker
Requirements:

- A list of all repos that are forked from Technigo
- Your username and profile picture
- Most recent update (push) for each repo
- Name of your default branch for each repo
- URL to the actual GitHub repo
- Number of commits for each repo
- It should be responsive (mobile first)
- A visualisation, for example through a pie chart, of how many projects you've done so far, compared to how many you will do (in total it will be 19 weekly projects 🥳) using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).


## The problem

This project wasn't easy to get my head around. It took me a while to get all fetches to show. I also struggled a bit with the chart.
