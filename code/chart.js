	// I said "for each sandwich let's take only the bread from it and prepare bread bait for fishing".
	// So, for each sandwich, we throw away all content from insid (ham, cheese etc.) and use bread to prepare bait.
	// We end up with a bag of bread baits.
	// Same goes for this code implementation - for each repo object we iterate through, we only take the name property and size property.
	// So, we end up with array of names and array of sizes that we can use as labels and data for charts!
