# GitHub Tracker
The project was to create a place to keep track of the GitHub repos that I'm using at Technigo Boot Camp. For this project I continued practicing my JavaScript and API skills.


## The problem
I started the project after going through all the study material. And I decided to make the site look similar to my real GitHub site. The first part of fetching my repositories and my user info was pretty straight-forward. However, there were some tricky parts and some new solutions to learn as well. The code coachers lectures for this project were very helpful and helped me solved the parts where I got stuck, for example how to get the pull requests/commit messages. From the lectures I also learned about dynamic ID's and the difference between 'find' and 'filter' when fetching data.
If I had more time I would have liked to dive deeper into the API and fetch more data, for example languages.
